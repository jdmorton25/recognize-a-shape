# Recognize a shape
The program can recognize 3 types of shape: circle, rectangle, triangle.\
Firstly, you need load or train your model. For training model you need create a dataset. You can generate it if you run 'data.py' (in file fields 'train_samples_count', 'test_samples_count', this is amount of pictures which will be generated). So you prepare to train your model, run 'main.py' and press 'train' (it is reaaaaly long process).\
Program has a canvas where you can draw a shape and press 'predict'. There is a prediction in the left bottom corner.\
Also there are options, you can change brush color and brush width.
